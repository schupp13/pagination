# pagination
This project takes a dynamic list of students and neatly breaks them up to 10 students per page. It also makes pagination links at the bottom of the page, also dynamically depending on the number of students.
Also, there is a search feature. there is a 'keyup' EventLisner for the search input field that allows you to filter the list in real time, also there is 'click' EventLisner for the submit button, in case someone were to copy/paste in a students name.
